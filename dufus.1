.TH DUFUS 1
.SH NAME
dufus \- disk usage for us
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dufus
[
.I directory
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dufus
(disk usage for us) is a simple disk usage analysis tool for Plan 9.
It provides a graphical breakdown of the on-disk usage of files and directories,
allowing the user to visualize which files and directories are consuming
the most space.
.PP
If no
.I directory
is specified,
.I dufus
analyzes the current directory.
The
.I directory
argument specifies the top-level or root directory from which to start the analysis.
This is useful for examining specific portions of the filesystem.
.PP
The visualization consists of two main components:
.TP
.B List View
An interactive file list showing directories and files with their respective sizes
and icons for clear visual distinction.
.TP
.B Treemap View
A treemap representation where rectangles represent files and directories,
with the size of each rectangle proportional to the file or directory size.
The visualization employs enhanced layout algorithms that naturally express
recursive directory structures and any fractal-like patterns that may exist.
.PP
.I Dufus
adheres to Plan 9 design principles of simplicity and modularity, doing only 
the essential tasks of collecting file/directory usage information and providing 
a basic visualization that summarizes this data.
.SH INTERFACE
.PP
The application window has three main sections:
.TP
.B File List
The upper pane displaying files and directories in a list format with icons
and size information.
.TP
.B Treemap Visualization
The lower pane showing files and directories as proportionally-sized rectangles.
Directories are colored based on their depth in the file hierarchy, creating
a natural representation of recursive structures.
.TP
.B Status Bar
Shows current path and total size information at the bottom of the window.
.SH USAGE
.PP
Navigation can be done with both mouse and keyboard:
.TP
.B Mouse
Click on list items to select them. Double-click on a directory to navigate into it.
Click on items in the treemap to select them in the list.
.TP
.B Keyboard Navigation
.TP
.B q
Quit the application
.TP
.B o
Open directory
.TP
.B u or h
Navigate up to the parent directory (vim-style for h)
.TP
.B r
Return to the root directory
.TP
.B j
Move selection down (vim-style)
.TP
.B k
Move selection up (vim-style)
.TP
.B l or Enter
Navigate into selected directory (vim-style for l)
.TP
.B ?
Toggle help display
.SH COLOR CODING
.PP
The visualization uses colors to differentiate between item types:
.TP
.B Depth-Based Gradient
Directories are colored using a gradient based on their depth in the filesystem hierarchy,
ranging from indigo (deepest) to red (shallowest)
.TP
.B Sky Blue
Files are shown in a consistent color
.TP
.B Gold
Currently selected item
.SH VISUALIZATION DETAILS
.PP
The treemap visualization employs several techniques to effectively represent filesystem structures:
.TP
.B Adaptive Layouts
Layout patterns change based on directory depth and available space
.TP
.B Spiral Layouts
Some directory levels use spiral layouts for a more organic representation
.TP
.B Proportional Sizing
All rectangles are sized proportionally to their disk usage
.TP
.B Recursive Depth Coloring
Colors change based on the recursive depth in the filesystem
.TP
.B Metadata Display
Additional information displayed for larger directory rectangles
.SH FRACTAL FILESYSTEM GENERATOR
.PP
A companion script,
.B fractal_fs.rc
, can be used to generate filesystem structures that mimic various fractal patterns.
This provides an excellent demonstration of dufus's visualization capabilities.
.TP
.B Usage:

.B Patterns Generated:
Sierpinski triangle, Mandelbrot-like, Koch snowflake, and Dragon curve directory structures

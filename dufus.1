.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dufus
[
.I directory
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dufus
(disk usage for us) is a simple disk usage analysis tool for Plan 9.
It provides a graphical breakdown of the on-disk usage of files and directories,
allowing the user to visualize which files and directories are consuming
the most space.
.PP
If no
.I directory
is specified,
.I dufus
analyzes the current directory.
The
.I directory
argument specifies the top-level or root directory from which to start the analysis.
This is useful for examining specific portions of the filesystem.
.PP
The visualization consists of two main components:
.TP
.B List View
An interactive file list showing directories and files with their respective sizes
and icons for clear visual distinction.
.TP
.B Treemap View
A treemap representation where rectangles represent files and directories,
with the size of each rectangle proportional to the file or directory size.
.PP
.I Dufus
adheres to Plan 9 design principles of simplicity and modularity, doing only 
the essential tasks of collecting file/directory usage information and providing 
a basic visualization that summarizes this data.
